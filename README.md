  My Code Louisville Front End Project: Random Commenting Website
  
  Files are located in the "my_project" folder. 
  
  My random commenting website allows users to input their names and provide a greeting or comment for everyone to see. It's kind of like an overly simplified blog. I didn't feel the need to add an edit option since a user could simply remove their old post and start a new one. The posts arn't intended to be a novel so creating a new one and removing the old one seemed to be an easier method for updating the posts.
